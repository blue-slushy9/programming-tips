Here's a typical workflow:

1. Fork the Repository: Create a copy of the original repository.

2. Clone Your Fork: Download the forked repository to your local machine.

3. Create a New Branch: Create a new branch for your specific feature or bug fix.

4. Make Changes: Edit the code as needed.

5. Commit Changes: Commit your changes to your local branch.

6. Push Changes to Your Fork: Push your local branch to your remote fork on GitHub.

7. Create a Pull Request: Once you're satisfied with your changes, create a pull request from your fork to the original repository.

Key Point: The pull request is essentially a request to the original repository's maintainers to merge your changes into their main branch. You can create this pull request at any time after you've pushed your changes to your fork.
